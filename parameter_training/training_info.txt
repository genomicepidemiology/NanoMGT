To retrain NanoMGT paramters on new data, do the following:

1.) Select the data to train on. For simulating multistrain sample, isolates from a series of species should be selected
and a json should be constructed similar to mixed_isolates.json where all sequencing IDs/prefixes are dived based on species.
2.) Adjust the variables in generate_training_and_validation.jsons.py to create JSON files for both training and validation sets.
If few samples are used, these files may need to be altered manually as the script will use the first 3 isolates for training no matter what.
3.) Adjust the variables in generate_batch_jsons.py to simulate the batch JSON files.
4.) Adjust the variables in gernerate_reads_mixes_from_jsons.py to generate multistrain samples.
This script assumes seqtk is installed and avaliable in your path (conda install -c bioconda seqtk)
5.) Adjust the variables in the parameters_train.py script and run it to train.
The output will be both JSON files with the parameters for each iteration round and MAF value.
The final output is the model.json (name will depend on the variable), which can be used when running Nanomgt by giving its path.
In training on an HPC, it should be considered to train seperate MAF values in different jobs, as they can be parallelized.
